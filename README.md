# Regression Machine Learning Algorithms Practice

This repository contains practical implementations of various regression machine learning algorithms. Each algorithm is implemented using Python, and includes well-documented code and examples to demonstrate its application. The primary purpose of this repository is to serve as a resource for learning and practicing regression techniques.

## Algorithms Included

1. **XGBoost Regressor**
   - A powerful and efficient implementation of gradient boosting for supervised learning tasks.

2. **Ridge Regression**
   - A linear regression model that incorporates L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.

3. **Lasso Regression**
   - A linear regression model with L1 regularization to enhance feature selection.

4. **Multiple Linear Regression**
   - A standard linear regression model used for predicting continuous outcomes using multiple features.

5. **KNN Regressor**
   - A non-parametric algorithm that predicts values based on the closest data points in the feature space.

6. **Decision Tree Regressor**
   - A tree-based model that splits data into subsets to make predictions.

7. **Random Forest Regressor**
   - An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and robustness.
