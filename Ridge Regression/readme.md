# Ridge Regression on Insurance Dataset

This repository contains a regression-based machine learning solution to predict outcomes on an insurance dataset using Ridge Regression. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the application of Ridge Regression, a regularized linear regression technique, to improve predictions and handle multicollinearity in the dataset.

## Project Overview

The project involves:

- **Dataset**: A dataset containing insurance-related features such as age, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and insurance charges.
- **Objective**: Predict insurance charges based on the given features.
- **Model**: Ridge Regression, a linear model with L2 regularization.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: R-squared (R²).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

Install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/teamarnab/All-Regression-Models/tree/main/Ridge%20Regression
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd ridge-regression-insurance
   ```

3. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python ridge_regressor.py
   ```

4. The script will output:
   - Model evaluation metrics R²

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following features:

- **age**: Age of the individual
- **sex**: Gender of the individual
- **bmi**: Body Mass Index (BMI)
- **children**: Number of dependents
- **smoker**: Smoking status (yes/no)
- **region**: Geographic region
- **charges**: Insurance charges (target variable)

## Results

- **Best Parameters**: Regularization strength (`alpha`) determined using cross-validation.
- **Performance Metrics**: R-squared (R²): _Value_

## Features

- L2 regularization to handle multicollinearity.
- Cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning.
- Comprehensive evaluation using multiple metrics.
